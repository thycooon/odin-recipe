    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <!-- <h3>Sub heading</h3> -->
    <ul>
        <li>3 russet potatoes, Scrubbed clean</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, Canola or Olive Oil work as well</li>
        <li>Salt/Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2.5 cups cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon, uncooked</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>2 green onions, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Take out the bacon and set it aside for 5 minutes (this makes it crispier).</li>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into approximately 1/2-inch slices. Use a pastry brush to lightly coat the tops with oil. Flip and repeat. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake the slices on a baking sheet in the oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>As the potatoes bake, cook the bacon over low heat. Use kitchen tongs to flip them periodically for even cooking. Set them aside once finished, leave the bacon drippings.</li>
        <li>Remove the potato slices from the oven and lightly brush with bacon drippings. Flip and repeat. Bake for 10 more minutes. Meanwhile, crumble the bacon.</li>
        <li>Decrease the heat to 350 degrees. Top the potatoes with grated cheese and crumbled bacon. Place back in the oven until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the slices from the oven. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning, then top with green onions. Serve with sour cream and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
